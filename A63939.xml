            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:97453:6"/>and foreign to our Natures, or ſo very far above us, that we muſt run away like People Afrighted out of our Wits, to hide from all ſuch Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Corners of Thick Darkneſs!

Thus far, I humbly conceive, we may ſafely climb Our <hi>Scala Coeli;</hi> to the Veil that interpoſeth between us and the <hi>Inner Court;</hi> to the Gate of the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> and no farther.

Aſtronomers have long ago reckoned up 1022 of them that are viſible; and 'tis concluded, thoſe that are inviſible are far the greater number; Pſalm 17.. <hi>He telleth the number of the Stars, and call them all by their Names,</hi> If the Stars of Heaven be ſo numerous, what are the Inhabitants that <hi>dwell beyond!</hi> I grant 'tis a LittleFlock that goes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, compared with the many, many Damnel Souls that go to Hell, but as God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15.5. <hi>Look now towards Heaven and tell,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The nnmber of them them that ſtand about the Throne, is ten thouſand timesten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands ſtand before him!</hi> Rev. 5.11. <hi>He keepeth mercy for thouſand of them that

Such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is too great for us; it with an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reverence of the Divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Wiſdom.

                     <p>I Shall here ſpeak of the other Inſevlour Appurtenances of Heaven, I chooſe to range them under that notion, becauſe I intend not ſo much a <hi>Lecture of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> as a plain diſcourſe of Divinity. I mean the <hi>Comets, Thunder and Lightning, Wind and Air, Vapours and Exhabations, Storms and Tempeſts, Hail, Rain and Snow, ſtrange Apparitions and Phenomena.</hi> I hope my time will not be quite loſt, nor I cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd for impertinent, in treating on theſe things; God himſelf therefore exhibiting them that we might duly meditare upon them, and deduce Inferences thence for his Glory.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Comets and Blazing Stars,</hi> or whatever elſe of that nature appears in the Heavens above us. I paſs over thoſe <hi>Miteors of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97453:18"/>leſſer moment, Falling Stars, Burning Launces, Flying Dragons, Skipping Goats, Ignes Fatui and licking Fires,</hi> as exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of inferiour wonder. <hi>Comets</hi> are the moſt ſtupendious. I hope, no body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians is ſo ſilly as <hi>Democritus,</hi> who took them for the <hi>Souls of the Saints</hi> Trimphing in Glory: Or as others, <hi>Fires carried thither by Spirits,</hi> only to aſtoniſh the World.</p>
                     <p>Whatever they are generated of (for I will not meddle here with the Phyſical Conſideration) their meaning is ſomething; the God of Nature, who is ſo Wiſe, as to make nothing in vain, without all doubt puts them in the Heavens for <hi>ſome ſign or other:</hi> Nor dare I be peremptory, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the particular ſignification. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, the moſt that we can read in thoſe <hi>Coeleſtial Hierogliphycks</hi> is, that God is going to do ſome great thing in the World; and that at the hanging out of thoſe Flags, it behoves men to enquire into their Lives, and ſearch their ways more narrowly, and <hi>prepare — to meet their God,</hi> who is coming to judge the World in equity, and maketh theſe <hi>Flames of Fire</hi> his Harbingers to prepare his way, and give notice of his coming. I ſhall not trouble you with particular Inſtances
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97453:18"/>of theſe kind of Meteors; the Scripture tells us at the <hi>Birth of our Saviour a Star appeared,</hi> which perhaps was the <hi>Comet</hi> ſpoken of by Heathen Authors in the days of <hi>Anguſtus,</hi> of a ſtupendious great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon which the Tibertine Sibyl ſhewed the Emperor the Divinity of our Saviour in theſe words, <hi>Hic Puer Major te eſt, Ipſum adora.</hi> Our laſt <hi>great Comet,</hi> I doubt not, was of extraordinary ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not to us only, but to whole Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope and farther, ſo far as it was conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous. <hi>What a Gracious God have we, that never ſcarce goes about any great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions or Changes in the World, but he gives warning</hi> beforehand! as if, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take us tardy! He ſhews his <hi>ſigns in the Heavens above,</hi> when he is about to do any great Work in the Earth beneath! And therefore as <hi>Darius</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 6.26, 27. <hi>Let men tremble and fear before this God, for he is the Living God and ſteadfaſt for ever, his Kingdom</hi> that which <hi>ſhall not be deſtroyed; and his Dominion ſhall be even unto the end; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth and reſcueth, and worketh ſigns and wonders in Heaven and Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Thunder and Lightning,</hi> called by the Pſalmiſt the Voice of God, and by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97453:19"/>ſome ſuppoſed to be that <hi>Trumpet</hi> that ſhall <hi>ſound</hi> at the laſt day to raiſe the Dead, and to call to Judgment.</p>
                     <p>I will not trouble you with declaring the <hi>ſtrange and divers effects of this kind of Meteor,</hi> its hurting of things Inward, when the Outward are ſafe; ſhattering the Bones, when the Fleſh is left ſound; melting the Blade of the Sword, when the Scabbard is free; breaking the Veſſel, when the Wine flows not away; exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poiſonous Creatures from their Venom, and infuſing it into thoſe who are not ſo; ſtriking men dead, and leaving them in the ſame poſture it found them, as if ſtill alive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is enough to ſay, that 'tis a <hi>ſtupendious Meteor,</hi> and may well be called the Voice of the Divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency—<hi>Job</hi> 37.2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c. Job</hi> 26.6, — 14. It is ſaid of <hi>Nero,</hi> that a <hi>Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt</hi> fell upon his Table, and ſtruck the Cup out of the Emperors Hand. And we have known in <hi>our</hi> Age ſome ſtrong Towers and high buildings demoliſhed to the very gound with Lightning. <hi>Some Men ſtruck dead,</hi> ſome lamed, ſome blinded; Trees clove aſunder. A Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divine of our Nation tells of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Perſon, walking abroad with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Lord's Day, when it thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97453:19"/>to his Companion telling him of it, made anſwer — 'tis nothing but a <hi>Knave Cooper beating of his Tubs;</hi> but he had not gone much farther, but himſelf was ſtruck dead. This may teach us to put on a Reverential awe of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty at ſuch ſeaſons! That Emperor (<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi>) who uſed to brave it out, as if he meant to vye with the Almighty, and cry — <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Divine Patience, but no ſafe example for imitation! The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt is more ingenuous, Pſal. 29. — <hi>&amp;c. Give unto the Lord (O ye Mighty) &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1, 2, 3, 4. To ſee all the lower World cover'd with thick Clouds, and the Cracks of Thunder ſhake the very Pillars of the Earth, and terrible Flaſhes and Corruſcations of Ligtning, with a ſpeedy pace fly from one end of the Heavens to the other; is ſo like the Voice of God, and a Type or Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of that <hi>Black Gloomy Day,</hi> which ſhall put a period to the World, that it may well be a <hi>Memento</hi> of our Duty and Reverence we owe to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and may well put that Queſtion into our Mouths — <hi>Who ſhall be able to ſtand, when God appears!</hi> When this Great and Terrible God ſhall by the ſound of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97453:20"/>this <hi>Trumpet,</hi> or the Voice of an Arch-Angel, ſummon the World to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who ſhall dare to appear before him! If the giving of the Law, and the enacting, or rather promulgation of our Religion upon <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> was ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful — as <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.16. — Chap. 20.18, 19. — What will the <hi>Great Aſſizes</hi> be, when all the men that ever lived in the World ſhall be called to give up their laſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and receive their Final Doom! <q>Then Oh! — Come ye Mountains and fall upon us, and ye Rocks cover us, and hide us from the Wrath of the Lamb!</q> Then Oh!

We are <hi>ſo blind, ſo near home!</hi> And 'tis <hi>enough</hi> to make us <hi>bluſh</hi> at our own weakneſs; and <hi>ſuch ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> ſhould make us <hi>humble;</hi> and <hi>ſuch humility</hi> ſhould make us <hi>learn!</hi> and till we are thus qualified, we are not fit to learn.</p>
                     <p>What a pround lump of Clay is fooliſh Man, that cannot comprehend things ſo <hi>near</hi> him, things meerly natural, things ſo common and ordinary; and yet will call every Point of his Religion, even the ſublimiſt Myſteries to the Tribunal of Mear Reaſon! And edetermine in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Branches and Punctilio's as perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily and deciſively, as if he had been <hi>Privy Counſellour to the Almighty!</hi> and judge others cenſoriouſly, unkindly, for differing from him but in the <hi>leſſer, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, difficult Points of Religion! and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute ſeverely for not knowing and believing with equal clearneſs as himſelf.</hi>

                     <p> But beſides, — We are often wondring at the <hi>Nature of God himſelf;</hi> and cannot tell how to frame a Notion of a Being every where preſent: Is not the Air and Wind a fit Emblem to <hi>ſhadow-forth this Attribute of the Divinity to us!</hi> Is not the Air in every Creviſs of our Houſes! in our Noſtrils! in our very Bowels! Doth it not fill the World! and enter into the ſmalleſt pores of our Bodies! and yet 'tis but a Creature, and we ſee it not! <hi>Why ſhould we think it ſuch an impoſſible thing for the God of Heaven to fill all places with his Preſence, and yet be limited to no bounds! nor viſible to any Eyes!</hi> The ſame word that we uſe to ſignifie <hi>Air,</hi> is uſed alſo to expreſs the Spirit of God by, in almoſt all the Languages, <hi>viz. Spiritus,</hi> Latine; <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>I have one thing more to remark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>this Meteor,</hi> as tending very much to ſet forth the Glory of God; and that is, its <hi>divers <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes and Effects.</hi> 'Tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97453:21"/>that ſuch a thin, tenuious, inviſible Body as that is, ſhould ſerve for ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and excellent purpoſes. Conſider them and wonder. It <hi>carries all the Fowls of the Air,</hi> (which would no more be able to fly without it, than the <hi>Fiſhes of the Sea to ſwim without Water;</hi>) it bears up the heavy Clouds, and fans, purges and tranſports them from place to place; ſo that we ſay truly, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.10. that the Divine Glory doth <hi>ride upon the Cherubs,</hi> and <hi>flies upon the Wings of the Wind:</hi> — it is a Faithful Meſſenger in the Hand of the Almighty to bring Tokens of Kindneſs, or Judgments to a People: One while <hi>Flies and Caterpillars</hi> innumerable, <hi>Frogs and Lice; Plagues</hi> and peſtilential infections; another while <hi>Quails</hi> and Manna, Fleſh and Feather'd Fowl, Rain, Plenty and Proſperity: In ſhort, it <hi>fans our Lungs, and walks to and fro through our Noſtrils every moment,</hi> and we are not able to breath without it: And yet this ſo uſeful, ſo neceſſary, ſo common a Creature we cannot ſee, we cannot comprehend! <hi>In God we live, move and have our being,</hi> he is within us and without us, and we know him not! and no abſurdity in all this!</p>

                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97453:22"/> 4. I might add to theſe, <hi>Storms and Tempeſts,</hi> not as ſpecifically different from them, but yet ſuch as may require a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration by themſelves. I mean thoſe more <hi>violent eruptions of Wind and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,</hi> or other watry Exhalations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, as either by their <hi>ſuddainneſs or violence,</hi> or ſurprizing and contrary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeem prodigious, or prove hurtful to us. Theſe are ſometimes ſo dreadful, that they <hi>overturn Trees, Houſes, Cities;</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run whole Countries with a deluge of Waters! drowning or ſwallowing up the Inhabitants! <hi>rending ſometimes Rocks aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and carrying them into the midſt of the Sea; ſometimes dividing parcels of Land from the Continent, and <hi>carring them into the Ocean, for Iſlands;</hi> of which Hiſtories are full of Examples. All that I ſhall remark upon this Particular is, that as the Storms are of God's ſending, ſo they are ſubject to his Government, Nah. 1.3, 4. <hi>The Lord hath his way in the Whirlwind, &amp;c. vide</hi> Pſal. 107.25, 26, 27, — 29. and Pſal. 148.8. <hi>The ſtormy wind fulfilling his word.</hi> You know the ſtory <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. But that which I drive at in theſe quotations is this, that he who <hi>rules the raging of the Sea,</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:97453:22"/>and <hi>ſtilleth the violent Storms of the Wind, and Waters,</hi> is able alſo to appeaſe the <hi>madneſs of a People;</hi> to huſh the noiſe and tumult of the World into a deep ſilence; to <hi>turn our Spears into Pruning-hooks,</hi> and our <hi>Swords</hi> into <hi>Plough-ſhears;</hi> to give us inſtead of a Storm a Calm; in our own Breaſts, in our Houſes and Families, in our Churches and Nations! Had not we beſt then in ſuch caſes, ariſe from our ſleep every one and call upon his God — as <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. and if our Lord ſeem to ſleep too, let us go and awaken him, in good earneſt, and ſay, <hi>Lord ſave us, or we periſh.</hi> And then he that keepeth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and never ſlumbers nor ſleeps, will ariſe and ſcatter our Enemies, and ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf mighty in our Salvation; upon the ungodly he will rain down Snares, Fire and Brimſtone and an horrible Tempeſt; <hi>This ſhall be the portion of their Cup,</hi> Pſal. 11.6. <hi>For the righteous Lord loveth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, his Countenance doth behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>

I will not ſtay now to ſhew the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſefulneſs of all theſe in their <hi>Kind, Order and Seaſons;</hi> nor if I cared to ſpend time upon it, have I skill to do it perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97453:23"/>Something might be ſaid, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps every one is not well ſenſible of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Wiſdom, as well as the Power and Goodneſs of God in uſing ſuch a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe method</hi> in manuring of the Earth, and <hi>nurſing of Sublunary Bodies.</hi> I ſhall conclude this with only that emphatical exhortation of the Pſalmiſt, 147.12. <hi>ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97453:25"/>for that I know not; it may be it was there before; but not diſcovered: But however 'twas a caſe extraordinary; and no prejudice to the order of the reſt; we have loſt none of our <hi>Seaſons, Day and Night, Summer and Winter</hi> have kept their times: The <hi>Sun</hi> its Revolutions, the <hi>Moon</hi> its due Changes; the <hi>Stars</hi> their proper Periods and exact motions; the ſtanding ſtill of the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time; and the going back of it on <hi>Ahaz</hi> Dial, are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous inſtances, and not to be parallel'd in other Ages.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Greatneſs of them.</hi> Small Bodies are eaſily managed, and apt to motion; but Great Ones move ſlowly, according to the Courſe of Sublunary Nature. But they in the Etherial Orbs are of ſo vaſt a bigneſs, that <hi>that</hi> Conſideration doth mightily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate and <hi>greaten the Wonder.</hi> That the Sun, Moon and Stars, all of them ſo big, ſhould move continually without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, or period, is an <hi>Accent</hi> upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The various Qualities they are of, and the different motions they make,</hi> do yet raiſe the Wonder to a higher Strain, to keep all one motion, eſpecially if all of one nature,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97453:26"/>were not ſo very much: but to move from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt</hi> from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North</hi> again, as ſome of them do; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, is an augmentation of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Without Period.</hi> Flowers wither: Trees rot: Stones decay: Man dies. The very Face of things below will ſhortly ceaſe to be; and another ſucceed. The Day dies, and ſo doth the year: And Stones and Caſtles here decay; every thing here is weary of Motion. The Apoſtle tells us—<hi>The whole Creation groans:</hi> But here it Groans and Dies; only what is a kin more nearly to Heaven, and borders upon that Court, is of a more laſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, of a more conſtant Motion, of a more perpetual Duration. <hi>Since the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fell aſleep, all things</hi> (of that kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the upper Regions) <hi>continue as they were from the beginning of the Creation,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.4, 7. <hi>For the Heavens are by the ſame word of God, by which they were Created, kept in ſtore, reſerved unto Fire againſt the Day of Judgment.</hi>

Mankind is born with his Eyes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſet than all the reſt of the Creation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his looks are by Nature more ſublime and lofty: Let us look up earneſtly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe <hi>lucid Spangles, thoſe ſparkling Globes</hi> over our Heads, and uſe our Eyes to ſome good purpoſe: Let us make thence ſome Practical Deductions for our imitation, at leaſt emulation; and ſcorn to Truant and Loiter here, at that rate, as uſually we do. <hi>Let no Temptation ſoſten our Spirits into an unneceſſary repoſe,</hi> nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us unduly to depart our Orbs, to run back, or ſtart aſide. <hi>Let us never be weary of well doing.</hi> Particularly,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us never be weary of the duty of Prayer.</hi> 'Tis an excellent exerciſe, and ſuch as we ought continually to be intent upon: Our Saviour <hi>ſpoke a Parable</hi> (Luke 18.1, 2.) <hi>unto his Diſciples, that men ought always to Pray, and not to Faint.</hi> And the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Continue in Prayer and Watch in the ſame with thanksgiving,</hi> &amp;c. And 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi> And let this amongſt many others be one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97453:27"/>Argument to perſwade us to aſſiduity in this kind of Devotion, <hi>viz. That God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is continually from day to day, from night to night, ſerving and ſupplying our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, by the Miniſtery of the lower Heavens, (all the Hoſts of the Etherial Regions are in continual employment for our Good)</hi> why then ſhould we diſdain to beſtow ſome few Minutes upon warm and ſerious Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the God of Heaven? Let neither the Day or Night go away without a Teſtimony of our Devotion. Let not God hereafter ever cite the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> for to bear witneſs to our Ingratitude. You know the Story of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the honour of his Memory, <hi>That three times every day he open'd his Windows, and ſet his Face towards</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the God of Heaven,</hi> even then, when pinch'd with the cloſe Temptations of the Court under a Heathen Emperor.</p>
                     <p>Let us (at leaſt) twice a day do O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyſance to Heaven,—Offer (as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the Jews) <hi>a Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice</hi> continually: Let our Altars burn with Incenſe, at leaſt ſo often; and this ſhall not only perfume our Days and Nights, and make our Converſations ſmell ſweeter to our ſelves and Neighbours, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97453:28"/>be a fragrant Odor in the Noſtrils of the Almighty, <hi>And pleaſe the Lord better than a Bullock,</hi> &amp;c. Job 1.5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us Praiſe God continually, as long as we live let us praiſe the Lord; yea, let us ſing praiſes to him, whilſt we have any being,</hi> Pſal. 34.1. <hi>His Praiſes continue in my mouth,</hi> Pſal. 36.9.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us be continually employed in doing Good to others.</hi> And let us remember this, that our God cauſeth his Sun to ſhine, and Rain to Deſcend on the Juſt and Unjuſt. Let us try what we can to be like him; like our Heavenly Father, diffuſing our Rays to as wide a Circuit as poſſibly we can; not limiting our goodneſs to a few individual Perſons, or a <hi>Single Party,</hi> or a narrow bound, but (as our faculties will extend) to the Church Catholick, and the <hi>wide World in general.</hi> This is to be in truth—like the God of Heaven. And let our Charity never be diſcouraged, never tired. <hi>To do good, and to diſtribute, forget not,</hi> &amp;c. To make it plainer yet; God hath given us a Copy of his Infinite Goodneſs in General, to the whole World, in the face of the outward Heavens (as of his ſpecial good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Church in the Revelation of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97453:28"/>the Goſpel.) If we contemplate ſeriouſly the ſtructure and Properties and ſeveral Vertues of the Heavenly Bodies, we may read there in legible Characters, not only the Greatneſs and Glory, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs alſo of him that made them, and that to the <hi>whole Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> and that not for a ſpurt, a ſhort fit of two or three Ages, but of continual Duration; his Patience is Indefatigable, and his <hi>Beneficence reacheth to the end of time.</hi> Let us then, if we will aim at Perfection, and try to tread in our Father's ſteps, <hi>Do good unto all men,</hi> without wearineſs, and Communicate the Light of our Graces, to a whole Nation, a whole World if poſſible, and never grudg to lend our Candles to the Aſſiſtance of thoſe that are about us. And as for thoſe narrow Souls <hi>that confine their goodneſs to a Canton,</hi> or whoſe Light is like that of a flaming Meteor, or an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> or a Falling Star, they deſerve to lie down in Darkneſs, and never more riſe up again to Light or Glory. <hi>Levit</hi> 24.2. <hi>Cauſe the Lamps to burn continually.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us conſider a little the Imployment of the Saints and Angels in Heaven.</hi> 'Tis pretty hard to conceive with our preſent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97453:29"/>apprehenſions, the buſineſs of Eternity, and reconcile the Notion of a <hi>Compleat Happineſs,</hi> to the exerciſe of a continual Devotion, and yet this is handſomly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us in the <hi>Scheme of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies; the Sun, Moon and Stars are never weary,</hi> never decay, never wander out of their place, but ſtill are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in a continual Motion, and keep ſtill their brightneſs and glory; and yet they are inanimate, ſenſleſs Creatures. Why ſhould we think it ſtrange, or abſurd, that the bleſſed Spirits in the other World ſhould be ſtill employed in the Offices of Devotion, and yet ſtill poſſeſs'd of Eaſe and Bliſs? and (which I drive at) <hi>why ſhould we not ſtrike up, and mend our pace at preſent?</hi> Why do we often mutter and complain, <hi>as if it were a wearineſs to ſerve the Lord?</hi> And cry out, <hi>When will the Sabbath be over,</hi> that we may return to our worldly Cares and Pleaſures again? Is there ſo much difference indeed between Grace and Glory; between the Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice-ſhip and the Profeſſion; between the Church here and hereafter? Or is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible think ye to make ſo <hi>quick a return from one Extreme to another?</hi> To be all Earth and Fleſh, and ſin here, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Spirit and Holineſs there? Or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97453:29"/>muſt we not a little (at leaſt) be <hi>Heaven'd</hi> in our Minds now; and be in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion to the end of our happineſs? <hi>Having theſe things always in remembrance,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.15. or as Pſal. 119.112. <hi>Enclined to perform the Statutes of the Lord always,</hi> or Pſal. 1.2. <hi>Exerciſing our ſelves in his Law day and night?</hi> And when we can do this, and do it with delight, we are upon the brink of a bleſſed Eternity, upon the skirts of the Holy Land! upon the <hi>Borders of Heaven!</hi> when our Light ſhines without darkneſs (tho it do <hi>Twinkle</hi> now and then!) and ſhines <hi>continually;</hi> when our Devotion doth not Die with the Day, but glimmers through the darkeſt Night—then, and not till then, we are in a fair way to the Life of Angels, <hi>and the Spirits of Juſt men made perfect.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Learn we hence to look for that which is laſting.</hi> In this World we <hi>have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing City,</hi> nothing durable, no laſting motion, unleſs it be that of Changes and Vieiſſitudes, Summer and Winter, Day and Night, Peace and War, Health and Sickneſs, Life and Death; even the Earth changes its Face according to the Seaſons; and the Seas tho they flow continually, they are ſupplied from the Clouds above,

Were it not Wiſdom for us then to leave off building with ſo much anxiety here, to take down our Scaffolds, and get a <hi>Jacobs Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and climb up to that place of Angels,</hi> to ſend our Hearts before us, and caſt our Anchor ſafe within the Veil, and chooſe that other world for our portion, and think and ſpeak of it, and provide for it, and account it as our own, and pack up all our laſt cares and paſſions for it; that whilſt we live upon Earth, we may <hi>have our Converſations above,</hi> and then we ſhall be eternally ſafe <hi>from Hell beneath.</hi>

Their <hi>Hermes Treſmegiſtus, Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Haly,</hi> being Authors of great requeſt ſtill with our Aſtrologers and Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>What did they learn from hence?</hi> Truly a great deal more than ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians learn from Nature and Revelation both. I ſpeak not of all the poor dark Heathen World; but of ſome who were more ſerious and contemplative amongſt them. Who took more pains than their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97453:34"/>Fellows. And I dare ſafely ſay, that tho their Eyes were dim, and the Light they ſaw by but like the obſcure Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or the firſt Dawning of the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they might well School and Catechiſe ſome of our old Profeſſors, <hi>Gray-hair'd Chriſtians,</hi> for ſeven years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. It would be too large a task now to tell you what <hi>Leſſons they learn'd from the Contemplation and Study of theſe Things.</hi> Their Books of Moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, writ by <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Cicero, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, Iſocrates, &amp;c.</hi> were they preach'd in our Pulpits, were enough to fill ſome number of years with Sermons ſtrong enough for our Auditors of the Lower Form: And convictive enough to ſhame the major part of Chriſtians among us into bluſhing and confuſion. Read over but the <hi>Roman Twelve Tables, Plato's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public.</hi> the Laws of the ſeveral Heathen Nations about Religion, Sobriety, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And you'l find reaſon to fear left the <hi>Queen of the South,</hi> and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Tyre and Sidon,</hi> the <hi>Greek, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian and Barbarian</hi> will eſcape better, ſome of them at the Day of Judgment, than many of Chriſtendom that have both the Books wide open before them all the days of their life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>

                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:97453:35"/> 3. <hi>What might they learn? Anſw.</hi> All the Articles of our Chriſtian Creed, and all the Precepts of our Chriſtian Religion, except thoſe which refer to the Cauſe and Cure of our Miſery; viz. <hi>The fall of</hi> Adam, <hi>and the Interceſſion of the Second</hi> Adam: <hi>That there was a God, one only Supreme Maker of Heaven and Earth, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in the Attributes of Wiſdom, Power, Truth, Juſtice, Mercy, worthy to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with a Holy Life, Prayer, Praiſe, Obedience, and a pure Heart and Affection; one that had a Good Will to ſave us, one that would reward us with excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or Puniſhments, according to our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the other World:</hi> All this, and more than this they might have diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their <hi>Glimmering Light of Nature in only the Frontiſpiece of Heaven,</hi> if they had but uſed their Eyes. And ſo much many of them did not only learn, but teach, and make a publick and ſtout pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it to the World. <hi>The Exiſtence of one Supreme God, the Divine Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the World, the Immortality of the Soul, a Mediation between God and us, and almoſt all the Moral Duties of the Law in Subſtance; the diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments after this Life, diſtinct Places
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97453:35"/>and times of Worſhip, Prieſts and Prieſtly maintenance, and Attonements, and Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and ſomething like the Dedicating of their Infants to God by Baptiſm, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Devotions, and Family Worſhip, as well as that which was publick in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> All theſe, and much more, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted into the Body of the <hi>Heathen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> And excepting only ſome few Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our Creed, referring to the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and eſpecially the buſineſs of our Redemption, and the True Notion of our <hi>two Sacraments,</hi> and it may be the <hi>Reſurrection of our Bodies,</hi> it were not very hard, to make out all the reſt of our Religion demonſtrable by the meer Light of Reaſon. <hi>The inviſible things of God from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>What Practical Deductions may be made from hence?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>How great is God?</hi> A Contemplation of the Heavenly Fabrick will directly lead us to this point, <hi>viz.</hi> an admiration of the <hi>Divine Eternal Power of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi> For Rom. 1.19. <hi>that which may be known of God is manifeſt</hi> to all the World, <hi>for God hath ſhewed it to them.</hi> He hath ſhewed his Face in the Glaſs of his Works,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97453:36"/>and his <hi>Features</hi> there appear ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that 'tis a wonder it doth not fill our apprehenſions with a pregnant and awful conceit of his Infinite Majeſty and Power. The <hi>Splendor of the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes gives ſhine to all the World,</hi> ſo that now all the Inhabitants of the Round World have ſcope enough for Spiritual Contemplation, and the exerciſe of their Rational Faculties; and the <hi>Turk and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> both have a book large and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous enough, lying wide open before them, enough to employ all their ſtudies in, all the days of their Life. Who that conſiders a while <hi>the Nature of that God that made the Heavens, how he muſt ſtretch his Compaſs over the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, how he muſt mete out the Heavens with a Span, and comprehend the Duſt of the Earth in a Meaſure, and weigh the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance, and take up the Iſles as a very little thing, and meaſure the Waters in the hollow of his Hand, and make the Clouds his Chariot, and ride upon the Wings of the Wind; and climb up to the higheſt Orbs, and extend every Globe with the preſent thought; and hang not only the Earth, but the Heavens upon nothing; and this in the exacteſt order and perfection, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97453:36"/>no remarkable default ſhall appear in</hi> 6000 <hi>years in any part of all this Magnificent Building.</hi> — Who that conſiders a little the Nature of the Supream Architect, ſhall not be ready to cry out with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 8.1, 9. <hi>O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth! who haſt ſet thy Glory above the Heavens. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>What little low worthleſs Creatures are we?</hi> That God who is the Author of ſuch excellent Handy-work, that dwells in that inacceſſible Light, in ſuch a glorious Palace, who can make Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens at his pleaſure, and <hi>garniſh them in a moment,</hi> and fill the whole World with the Beams of his Glory, ſhould yet place his Affections ſo much on ſuch little ſilly things as we are! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.3, &amp;c. Shall I ſpeak my Opinion freely in this matter? I do conceive, that one great Reaſon why God hath laid out ſo much of his Excellency, and beſtowed ſo much of his Infinite Wiſdom and Power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creation of the Things that are above us, eſpecially the <hi>Heavens over our Heads,</hi> — was on purpoſe, to <hi>aſtoniſh proud man into a Religious Admiration of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97453:37"/>his, God,</hi> and an humble deteſtation of himſelf; for that's the very frame and temper which diſpoſeth man for the impreſſions of Religion, and the exerciſe of a devout affection. Iſa. 66.1, 2. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the Heaven is my Throne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A due conſideration of the Creation of the World,</hi> and eſpecially of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, belongs unto us all. <hi>Os Homini ſublime — &amp;c.</hi> if God doth preach to us by theſe <hi>things that are ſeen,</hi> and thereby reveal to the World <hi>the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> properties of the Divinity, then — we ought to hearken to this Voice, and make ſome good uſe of their Language. <q>
                           <hi>The Curious Spectator looks up to the Heavens, and examines every particular there, Quidni quaerat? Scit ill ad ſe pertinere. Tunc contemnit domicilii prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris anguſtias.</hi> Seneca. And (as he goes on) what is all the diſtance from the utmoſt Coaſts of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Indies? But a Voyage of a very few days, if thou fail with a good Wind: But that Heavenly Country above, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds of years affords ſpace for the ſwifteſt Stars to travel in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lett or moleſtation.</q> In ſhort, the very
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97453:37"/>Natural Propenſity of Mankind to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into thoſe upper Regions, and peer amongſt the Stars, is ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our concernment that way.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us beware of Idolatry,</hi> the fault of the Old Pagan World: Who when they ſaw thoſe <hi>Lights hung out at the Windows of Heaven,</hi> which ſhould have been but miniſterial to help them in the ſearch of him that made them, ſell down and worſhipped the Servants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their Maſter, the Candles at the Door inſtead of the Lord of the Houſe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.19. yet the Jews themſelves were ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of this Precept, that we find them often taxed for <hi>burning Incenſe to the Queen of Heaven;</hi> and <hi>worſhipping the Star</hi> Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan. And 'tis too well known, that the Heathens generally worſhipped the Sun, Moon and Stars; <hi>becoming vain in their imaginations;</hi> and <hi>tho they profeſſed themſelves Wiſe, they became Fools, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Glory of the Incorruptible God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Image</hi> of his Corruptible Creatures.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>By this Law, they who want a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Revelation, ſhall be judged,</hi> Rom. 2.12, 13, 14, 15. Let no man then (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within or without the Pale of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97453:38"/>Church) think to ſhroud his guilt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cloak of Ignorance. There's no Corner of the World ſo remote, no People ſo dark, where <hi>this Voice hath not been heard;</hi> the Muſick of the Spheres is ſoft and ſtill, but ſuch as ſhortly will make even <hi>both the Ears</hi> of the guilty ſinner tingle! The Language wherein theſe Sermons are preach'd to the World, is temperate and equal, it makes no great noiſe at preſent to them, who are buſie digging low in the Bowels of the Earth, but it hath a ſharp and heavy accent at the End. Let no man then upbraid the Almighty, as if he were a Severe Judge for calling all men to the ſame Judgment; for damning men that never had <hi>the knowledge of his Laws.</hi> Fear not, God will be juſt; he'll vindicate his Righteouſneſs from the foul aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and abuſes of a Scandalous World. Haſt thou <hi>ſinned without Law? without Law then thou ſhalt be tried,</hi> and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one but condemned too; and yet God clear from thy Blood, and juſt in all this! What a black Liſt of ſins doth the Apoſtle preſent thee with (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29, &amp;c.) all chargeable upon all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, <hi>Jew and Chriſtian, and Turk and Heathen,</hi> and damnable by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97453:38"/>the very Law of Nature! <hi>unrighteouſneſs, fornication,</hi> &amp;c. but that which affects us moſt in all this, is, that not only the poor Infidel is guilty in this Caſe, but a great part of Chriſtendom alſo! Not only they that have no other Law to read in, no other Rule to go by, <hi>but the Book of the Creation;</hi> but they alſo who have the Bibles in their hands, and the Creed upon their tongues end, and have all the advantages of Nature and Revelation both! When theſe very ſins (and as bad, or worſe) walk bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd within the Confines of the Church, and men of the beſt Creed and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the World are not aſhamed to commit the fouleſt ſins, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times account it their glory to boaſt of ſuch vices which ought not ſo much as to be named amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral live amongſt us, (it may be in this place now) whoſe ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations are ſtain'd with ſuch blots, as both the lights (both that of <hi>Poſitive Religion, and that of mere Natural</hi> Reaſon too) do abhor and condemn. And yet, which is mighty ſtrange, theſe very men do pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the hopes of eſcaping ſafely the Sentence of the Judge at the laſt day! And upon their Repentance they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97453:39"/>may; but elſe I cannot think of any plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Argument that will ſtand their Friend at the day of Judgment. And to drive the Nail farther yet; — it will not be enough for men to plead their Intereſt in a Church or Party in ſuch caſes: Let the Church be <hi>never ſo pure,</hi> nor the Profeſſion never ſo good, nor the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Knowledge and Information ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great; if under all theſe pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thou ſhouldſt play the Hypocrite, and live ill, thy own Mouth would condemn thee, and a whole <hi>Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> depoſe evidence againſt thee! And yet notwithſtanding all this, we may take up the complaint of the Prophet, Jer 18.13. <hi>Ask now among the Heathen, who hath heard ſuch things? the Virgins of Iſrael have done very horrible things.</hi> Thy poor men are tenacious of their Superſtitious Vanities; 'tis hard to make a Proſelyte to Chriſtianity amongſt them; they will Diſpute, <hi>Fight, die for their meer ſhadow of Faith:</hi> But Chriſtians will barter away their Conſcience, their Creed, their Heaven, their God for meer Vanities! <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14, 15. In ſhort, if it be true, what ſome of the poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Gentiles</hi> fancied, that the Sun, Moon and Stars do all look upon us, and are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97453:39"/>daily Spectators and witneſſes of all we do, it were well for many — <hi>if the Sun were indeed turned into Darkneſs, and the Moon into Blood, and the Stars would leave off their Shining,</hi> and the whole Face of the Heavens were reverſed, than thus to ſtand over our Heads and remark our Actions, in order to a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Convictive Teſtimony againſt us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11.</p>

                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:97453:40"/> 1. <hi>Its Terms,</hi> — or Bounds, — from Whence, and to Which the Sun moves. <hi>From the one end of the Heavens to the other, i.e.</hi> according to our apprehenſion and common ſenſe of things. For in Truth, the Heavens have neither Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor End, but are of a perfect <hi>Round Figure.</hi> Indeed this Notion was ſo long hid from the World, that not many hundred years agone, a <hi>German Biſhop</hi> was excommunicated for broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that there were <hi>Antipodes,</hi> — and that the Earth in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Heavens, was inhabited round; whereas now 'tis generally agreed upon, with good reaſon, by all the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late Ages.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Its ſwiftneſs.</hi> I need ſay little more upon this point, than what I ſaid before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sun according to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome Aſtronomers, goes in its motion 1000000 <hi>German miles,</hi> in the Judgment of others 261905 — in one hour. Whether either of them are in the right or no, I am not much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to determine.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97453:41"/>by its Diameter, its Compaſs <hi>(peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phery)</hi> and by that its motſon. Indeed its Courſe is ſo ſwift, ſo incredibly quick, that out <hi>late Philoſophers</hi> would fain find a nearer way to ſolve the Wiſdom of Nature, whoſe Principle it is to doeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing the neareſt way it can be done; and therefore have rackt their Brains to diſcover, if poſſibly, a miſtake in the caſe, and to prove that the Earth (which is by many degrees the leſs Body) doth move round, and not the Sun with ſo ſwift and daily a motion: But as yet the Evidence of that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not appear; ſo that we may on this point ſay, — <hi>it rejoyceth as a Giant,</hi> —&amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Sure I am, not all the Wit of Man, or Policy of Devils, could reduce the World to ſuch a Poſture, or put Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in ſuch a pleaſant frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as theſe do; could furniſh us with ſuch pure and untainted ſtreams of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Virtue and good Nature, as theſe Graces well got, and thoroughly attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And therefore — <hi>let your light ſo ſhine before men,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97453:76"/>order, and deſires to Dance with them; So if a Man takes up the reports of the World concerning <hi>ſerious Chriſtians,</hi> or ſees them at a diſtance buſily attending all the Duties of their Calling and holy Profeſſion, he thinks of them as <hi>Feſtus</hi> of <hi>Paul &amp; they are beſide themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But come we nearer to an Intimacy and familiar Acquaintance with the Rule of <hi>Holy Living,</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.15.17. <hi>She is more precious than Rubies, and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared unto her; her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97453:83"/>we ſhould be much more ſo, to keep up a Decency and Beauty in all our Actions; eſpecially when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that an Omniſcient Eye ſeeth all we do, and Angels do ſtill attend us, and all our <hi>ſecret things</hi> ſhall ſortly be broughtly into Cogniſance before the whole World, <hi>Turpe quid</hi> — &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>All things that are true, wiſe, and good, are beautiful:</hi> Indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Decency in any thing elſe, but what is conform to a holy rule, and what <hi>dares abide the examen of the Light,</hi> and the Tryal of a ſearching eye. Ignorance, Error, and Vice, are apt to ſneak, and the guilty ſinner hates the <hi>light, becauſe his deeds are evil.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Truth and Goodneſs, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their own Beauty, Order, Lovelineſs, and Excellency, are bold to appear before the <hi>Noon ſun:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sirs, if there be ſuch excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as theſe in the world, be exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to purſue after them; if Religion be lauidble, Chriſtinaity excellent, a ſincere Devotion, a fervent Zeal, a warm Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and an Honeſt Life, have any thing of <hi>Beauty</hi> and Commendation belonging to them, if it be a pleaſant thing to pour out the Soul in Prayer, to offer Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This Beauty of Religion commends it to the Approbation of the World, and makes the Church ſhine to thoſe that are without:</hi> It repreſents it lovely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting to all Beholders, and therefore for the ſake of thoſe incredulous ſouls that yet lye under prejudices, and the diſadvantages of an ill proſpect, we ſhould do what we can <hi>to make our light ſhine before men,</hi> and our Graces give a luſtre to our Principles, that if it be poſſible, and as much as lies in us, we may charm Proſelytes, court the Love and Embraces of the incredulous world, ſtop the mouths of contradicting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, make Proſelytes of all that know us, and are acquainted with our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations; let our Words be true, our Speech ſavory, our Tables ſober, our Port grave, our Actions honeſt, and our Worſhip Evangelical, and <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtance of our lives impreſs'd with

In a word, all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World <hi>living ſoberly, righteouſly and godly</hi> in their proper Orbs, all the Wheels of the ſame work performing office mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to one another, and all of them conſpiring to ſet forth the praiſe of him that made them; <hi>this is Beauty,</hi> and this is inviting even to the Enemies of our Religion.</p>

I leave it to the judgments of thoſe who are diſcreet, impartial, and unprejudiced, to make Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this way, and judge according to the <hi>Analogy of Faith;</hi> but this I am ſure of, that many, even well-meaning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, forget themſelves, and adopt ſuch Principles and Practices into their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as are in the judgment of any impartial and judicious Eye, of a Baſtard kind, perfectly <hi>Aliens to the Common-VVealth of Iſrael,</hi> and have no affinity at all with the Goſpel of our Saviour; and beſides theſe, even the beſt of us all ſometimes through the imperfection of our holineſs, the weakneſs of our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us be exhorted, if we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted any blemiſh or deſilement</hi> upon our Souls by ſin, if we have in any reſpect marr'd the Beauty of our Religion, let us make haſt to waſh in the <hi>Blood of that Immaculate Lamb that takes away the ſins of the World,</hi> &amp;c. to purge our Conſciences, and rinſe our Souls, and

                     <p>
                        <hi>Directions</hi> to this purpoſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us often look our Faces in the Glaſs of God's Law,</hi> James 1. 23. elſe we may be deformed, and not know it: St. <hi>Paul — I had not known ſin, but by the Law,</hi> &amp;c. Let us ſearch our Beauties with a curious Eye, and take heed leaſt we take Spots, black Patches, Moles, and Morphew, for any parts of our Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Let us beware of being Wiſe, and Holy, only in our own conceits. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceit is a common impoſture in this caſe, and how often do we ſee Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the groſſeſt Errors and greateſt Vices with the ſtrongeſt vigour and greateſt Zeal, and all this through Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and want of conſulting the Glaſs ſufficiently: <hi>Ye do err, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture.</hi> This is the only Rule to judge aright of Beauties by.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us often go into the Company
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97453:87"/>of thoſe that excell in Spiritual Beauty:</hi> Let the <hi>Excellent of the Earth</hi> be our Companions, and the beſt of Men our deareſt Aſſociates: Let us ſay with the Bleſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if we do ſo, by keeping Company with wiſe Men we ſhall learn Wiſdom, and by often converſing with Holy Men we ſhall underſtand mor eof Holineſs and Sanctity than we did before; we ſhall learn by their dreſs how to dreſs our ſelves better, and by their defects be admoniſhed to beware.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us beware of any thing that may ſoil our beauty:</hi> Let not the <hi>Sun look upon us,</hi> the Sun of Temptation, Sin, the World, and Vanity, which have too much influence upon us; and of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alſo, for that likewiſe is apt to ſhade our <hi>Beauty,</hi> and make our Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deformed, and our Graces uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Eyes of the World, and to our ſelves alſo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us acknowledge with thankfulneſs whence all our Beauty is derived,</hi> Pſal. 149. 4. 'Tis He that gives us all our fine Robes, that decks our Souls out with the Graces of his Spirit, that pours his Goodneſs and Mercy upon us, and makes
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97453:88"/>us ſhine with the <hi>Beauty of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;</hi> and therefore let us be ſtill humble, and give him the Praiſe of all that little good that appears in us — <hi>Not unto us — but to his Name give Glory, &amp;c.</hi> let us Pray ſtill for more Grace to be poured out upon us, that our Light may ſhine every day clearer and brighter, 'till it come to a <hi>perfect day;</hi> 'till we arrive at that bleſſed ſtate where our Faces ſhall ſhine as the <hi>Sun in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,</hi> and all our Graces, which be now but in the bud, veil'd over with the Infirmity of Humane Nature, and clouded with the remainders of our old Man, <hi>be ripen'd into a Compleat Glory,</hi> an accompliſh'd and unfading <hi>Beauty:</hi> And then ſhall that Song be ſung in good earneſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 1. <hi>Awake, awake, put on thy ſtrength, O Zion, put on thy beautfiul Garments, O Jeruſalem, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City, for henceforth there ſhall no more come into thee the uncircumciſed and the unclean.</hi>

                  <p>A FURTHER SPECIMEN OF THE HISTORY OF <hi>Remarkable Providences:</hi> WITH PROPOSALS At Large, For Printing the ſaid WORK By way of SUBSCRIPTION.</p>
                  <p>A Work of this Nature was ſet on foot about 30 years ago, by the Learned Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> Author of the <hi>Synopſis Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum;</hi> but, for what Reaſons we know not, it was laid aſide, and nothing has ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb facs="tcp:97453:91"/>on that Subject but a ſmall <hi>Eſſay,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite ſome others to go on with the Work. The Reverend Mr. <hi>T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RNER</hi> (whoſe late <hi>Hiſtory of all Religions</hi> hath met with good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation) having made Collections proper for ſuch an Undertaking, during the <hi>Courſe of his Reading, and Miniſtry,</hi> for near 30 years, and finding that it is not attempted by any other Hand, is reſolved to go on with it, as being fully ſatisfied, that a Work of this kind, muſt needs be of <hi>Great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe;</hi> eſpecially to ſuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minds as delight to obſerve the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which God doth give of himſelf, both in his Works of <hi>CREATION</hi> and <hi>PROVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCE;</hi> the former are ſufficient to render thoſe who have no other Inſtructors inexcuſable, as we are taught by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. and the excellency of the latter conſiſts in this, that they are the <hi>Real accompliſhments of his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word,</hi> ſo that to <hi>Record Providences,</hi> ſeems to be one of the beſt methods that can be purſued againſt the abounding <hi>ATHEISM</hi> of this Age, for by <hi>works of Providence, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a God, and the truth of his word</hi> have been extorted from thoſe very perſons who have boldly denied it; <hi>MEMORABLE</hi> is that paſſage of <hi>Aeſchyles</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> in <hi>Tragedy,</hi> who relating his Countreymens diſcomfiture by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> gives us this obſervation, that when the <hi>Grecians</hi> purſued them furiouſly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the great River <hi>Strymon,</hi> which was then frozen, but began to thaw, he did with his own Eyes ſee many of thoſe <hi>Gallants</hi> whom he had heard before maintain ſo <hi>boldly that there was no God,</hi> every one upon their knees, with eyes and hands lifted up, begging for mercy; and
<pb facs="tcp:97453:91"/>that the Ice might not break till they got over.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scepticks</hi> of this age, may poſſibly call ſuch a paſſage in Queſtion, but what can the moſt <hi>Obdurate Atheiſt</hi> ſay to thoſe Providences about the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were ſo clearly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the Scriptures, and part of 'em are viſible to their own Eyes. Is not this ſufficient to convince them of the being of an Omniſcient God, that the ſacred Scriptures are his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will;</hi> and that <hi>Chriſtianity is the only true Religion.</hi> We doubt not but thoſe men who are able to hold out againſt ſuch a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing demonſtration, will <hi>flout at this undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and expoſe all they can, but they may remember the Conqueſt which Truth made over their great Champions, Mr. <hi>Hobbs, My Lord Rocheſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Alan Broderick,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences which merit their thoughts, and may ſerve to ſtop their Mouths. But to come to the <hi>deſign in hand:</hi> It being certainly an incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent duty according to the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> for <hi>one Generation to praiſe the Works of the Lord to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to declare his mighty Acts,</hi> Pſal. 145.4.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. We have conſulted <hi>many,</hi> and deſign to peruſe all Authors that we can meet with, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern,</hi> who have writ on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (as <hi>The Treaſury of Ancient and Modern Times, Camerarius, Beard, Clark, Wanly,</hi> &amp;c. and others lately publiſht;) and make a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the <hi>Choiceſt</hi> Paſſages, in order to the <hi>PARALLEL</hi> betwixt ancient and modern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which cannot but be very ſerviceable, conſidering that many of thoſe Authors are now become <hi>ſcarce,</hi> who recorded the <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb facs="tcp:97453:92"/>of former ages;</hi> and that there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of remarkable paſſages, relating to the <hi>preſent age,</hi> ſcattered in ſo many Books, which its hardly poſſible for any <hi>one man</hi> to have all of 'em by him.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. We our ſelves have already collected, and received from Credible Hands, <hi>many remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Paſſages,</hi> which were never yet printed; and deſign to collect as many more as we can relating to this Preſent Age.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:97453:93"/>that ſo the Undertaker may not be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor diſcouraged in this <hi>uſeful attempt,</hi> which we have now a fair opportunity to accompliſh, having received promiſes of <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Great <hi>Learning and Curioſity;</hi> (We have alſo the promiſe of a <hi>Folio Manuſcript,</hi> written by the Famous Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> containing the moſt <hi>Memorable Things</hi> which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this laſt Age) and we aſſure all others that will be ſo kind as to impart their <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi> to us, that they ſhall be received with all <hi>Candor and Gratitude</hi> imaginable, and the <hi>Names of the Authors</hi> publiſhed, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that the publick may know to whom they are indebted for the promoting of ſuch an <hi>uſeful Work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the <hi>MERCIES and J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DGMENTS</hi> of God are not confin'd to any particular par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore as we have already collected, we deſign alſo to embrace <hi>all well atteſted Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> from Chriſtians of what Denomination ſoever, provided they have not a Tendency to reflect upon any ſubdiviſions of Proteſtants; for we will not inſert any thing that favours of Faction or Animoſity amongſt Brethren, but will endeavour to make the Work as unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable as may be, to al moderate and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men.</p>
                  <p>Seeing it hath pleaſed God to manifeſt much of his Glory in the <hi>Works of Creation,</hi> and much of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to men by inſpiring them with <hi>uſeful and delightful Inventions,</hi> we deſire, that ſuch as have made any Choice Collections, or Obſervations, relating either to <hi>NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE</hi> or <hi>ART,</hi> (Upon which <hi>TWO GENERAL HEADS,</hi> we have the Promiſe of a Large

                  <p>We do alſo invite all <hi>Divines</hi> and others, to communicate to us any Remarkable <hi>EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAPHS</hi> in Church-yards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe many of them contain a <hi>ſhort Hiſtory</hi> of the Perſons upon whom they are made; which is not to be found elſewhere, as we are fully ſatisfied by ſuch <hi>Collections of that ſort</hi> as we have made already.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, That nothing might be wanting to render our Work perfect, we have been at the charges to purchaſe what we found for our purpoſe in Mr. <hi>WILLIAM MILLER</hi>'s <hi>Catalogue</hi> lately publiſh'd, (which being a <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Collection of Papers and Pamphlets of all ſorts,</hi> from the year 1600 down to this day) we have been there accommodated with ſeveral Relations from divers parts of the Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as well as from Forreign Parts, (from whence we have lately received promiſes of great aſſiſtance) as alſo with <hi>Modern Inſtances</hi> upon <hi>Atheiſm, Murder, Adultery, Theft, Drunkenneſs,</hi> and other Subjects, no where elſe to be found, which will be no ſmall Entertainment to the

                  <p>The firſt we ſhall mention are the Earl of <hi>Marlbourgh</hi>'s Letters from on Board the Fleet, <hi>April</hi> 24. 1665.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Marlbourgh,</hi> whoſe two moſt Devout and Penitential Letters are herewith Publiſh'd, was a perſon of great Underſtanding and Wit: The Scene of his Life lay chiefly in <hi>Voyages</hi> and Expeditions by Sea, whereby he made many laborious Attempts to repair the Collapſed Eſtate of his Anceſtors; but it pleaſed not God to give him the Succeſs he hoped for therein.</p>
                  <p>It is wholly unfit for any Writer to touch upon any ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious Principles or Practiſes, that were as ſtains in his Life, ſince he hath, by his own Noble Pen in the following
<pb facs="tcp:97453:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>Letters, acknowledged them, and by his moſt exemplary Repentance waſhed them off.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Roger Coke</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Volume of his <hi>Detection,</hi> p. 142, mentions, <hi>That the Fight wherein the Duke of</hi> York <hi>beat the</hi> Dutch, <hi>and</hi> Opdam <hi>was blown up, was the 3d. of</hi> June, 1665. <hi>and that in this Fight the</hi> Engliſh <hi>loſt the Renown'd Earl of</hi> Marlbourgh, <hi>who tho' Admiral in</hi> K. Charles <hi>the firſts time, died here a private Captain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it pleaſed God, in that Naval Expedition, to work in him ſuch a ſenſe of his Sins, as did infinitely make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the former diſappointments he met with by Sea or Land.</p>
                  <p>The Date of his firſt Letter being the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and that of the Second, the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>May</hi> following, will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any Candid Reader, that the New Birth in him was accompanied with many <hi>pangs</hi> and <hi>efforts</hi> of great Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration during the firmneſs of his bodily Health, and much tranſcending the low Nature of poor <hi>Death-bed Repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which are ſo juſtly ſuſpected by our Practical <hi>Divines</hi> of all perſwaſions.</p>
                  <p>And here it is neceſſary to acquaint the Reader that theſe two <hi>Letters</hi> of diſtant <hi>Dates</hi> were ſent by his Lordſhip from the Royal Navy, incloſed in other Letters to Mr <hi>Tredewy,</hi> his Lordſhip's Agent in <hi>London;</hi> with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Inſtruction, both as to that to Sir <hi>Hugh Pollard,</hi> and that to Mr. <hi>Glaſcok,</hi> that each of them was to be delivered when Mr. <hi>Tredewy</hi> was credibly inform'd of his Lordſhips Death. His deſign being, that his Pen ſhould Preach Repentance to the World, in caſe he lived not to be a perſonal Adviſer thereof himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Publiſher hereof aſſures the Reader, that both the <hi>Letters</hi> had a happy influence on the lives of the two perſons, to whom they were directed, and that Sir <hi>Hugh Pollard</hi> having lent the <hi>Original Letter</hi> which was ſent to him, to Sir <hi>W. Davenant,</hi> to ſhew it to whom he pleaſed, Sir <hi>William</hi> ſhew'd it to the <hi>Publiſher</hi> among many others: And that Mr. <hi>Glaſcock</hi> permitted the <hi>Publiſher</hi> to take a Copy of that Letter directed to him. The Reader may then awaken his moſt ſerious Thoughts to conſider the two following Letters.</p>

                  <p> My Lord <hi>Marlbourgh</hi>'s Letter to Sir <hi>Hugh Pollard</hi> having been diſperſt throughout the Kingdom, this <hi>Remarkable Penetence</hi> of his Lordſhip was the Subject of <hi>general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> for a long time after, and 'tis not doubted but that his Lordſhip's Letter to Mr. <hi>Glaſcock</hi> (which was never printed but in this <hi>Specimen</hi>) will be as well received; and 'tis hoped, may have the ſame good Effect as the former had.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman who hath communicated to us theſe Letters ſent by the Earl of <hi>Marlbourgh</hi> to Sir <hi>Hugh Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi> and Mr. <hi>Glaſcock,</hi> is a <hi>Perſon of Quality,</hi> now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>London,</hi> and if any one hath the curioſity to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from his own mouth, about perfect certainty of the matters therein Related, if he repairs to Mr. <hi>Darker</hi> in <hi>Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head-Court,</hi> near <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi> he will be always ready to bring any Gentleman to ſpeak with him for further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
                  <p>It muſt needs be obvious to every conſidering Reader, that the ſame holy ſpirit who breath'd from the mouth of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of men, <hi>That all things in this World are Vanity and Vexation of Spirit,</hi> did make this <hi>Great Man</hi> ſenſible of the Truth thereof by his own Experience, and to expreſs it accordingly; and how obſervable is it, that that very Truth which he ſo ingeniouſly confeſſes <hi>himſelf to have neglected and diſpiſed,</hi> did at laſt make an entire Conqueſt over him, and force him to ſubmit, as if God would thereby let us ſee, that <hi>though not many Noble, and not many Wiſe are called,</hi> yet he does not leave the Goſpel without a Teſtimony, even from ſuch, but obliges them to confeſs, That <hi>the Wiſdom of this World is meer Fooliſhneſs with God,</hi> which will appear yet more by the following Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>It's taken notice of that Sir<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>In Sir</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan Brode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks <hi>Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sermon by</hi> Nathan Resbury <hi>Miniſter of</hi> Wandſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Decemb. 3. 1680.</note> 
                     <hi>Alan Broderick,</hi> who was a Gentleman of Extraordinary Learning and Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, did own with much Contrition, that a Long Scene of his Life had been acted in the <hi>Sports</hi> and <hi>Follies</hi> of Sin, that he had ſometime purſued a Pagan and abandon'd way, <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> it ſelf not excepted, wherein the poinancy of his Wit, and the ſtrength of his Reaſoning, even in that very Argument, the uſing of which proclaims a man in the Language of the Holy Scriptures, a Fool, may have been the occaſion of a great deal of miſchief towards ſome that are already gone to their Accounts.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſome years before his <hi>Death,</hi> the bent and tendency of his Life and Actions was Devout and Religious, and in
<pb facs="tcp:97453:98"/>his <hi>Private Converſation</hi> with his Miniſter, he would alway be Diſcourſing ſome Caſes of Conſcience about Retir'd Cloſet-prayer, or the Nature and Neceſſity of <hi>True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>—and in his laſt Sickneſs he thought himſelf under a mighty Incumbency to Pray, but was much haraſſed and anxious what to do, becauſe of his fear of not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, with all becoming Reverence and Seriouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>look you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my Conſcience is now as tender as wet Paper, torn upon every apprehenſion of the leaſt guilt before God</hi>—And as he had much ſtudied the Nature of Repentance, he would frequently complain, That he had a great jealouſie upon himſelf, leaſt he had not yet <hi>conceiv'd an horror</hi> anſwerable to his paſt Exorbitancies of Life, and had not made thoſe ſmart and <hi>pungent</hi> Reflections upon himſelf, that might become one that had ſo long, and in ſuch <hi>Exalted Degrees violated the Laws of his Maker,</hi> and made himſelf ſo Obnoxious to the Vengeance of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that if the <hi>cutting off one of his Hands</hi> with the other, were but a proper or likely way through the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of ſuch a wound to give him a juſt horror for his ſins, he would do that as willingly as he ever did any one Action that had given him the <hi>greateſt pleaſure of Life.</hi>—He alſo ſaid that by the grace of God, he had ſuch a <hi>ſenſe of the Conviction,</hi> and folly, and unreaſonableneſs of Sin, that no Argument, no Tentation ſhould prevail upon him to do the like again.—Having taken notice that all my Lord <hi>Rocheſters</hi> Religious breathings were accounted by ſome, the Raves and Delirancies of a ſick Brain, he did reſolve to have given the World a publick Account of the ſentiments he had of Religion, both as to the Faith and Practiſe of it, but was prevented.</p>
                  <p>But the next inſtance of the E. of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> is ſtill more convincing, who as it appears by his <hi>Funeral Sermon,</hi> did with very much abhorrence exclaim againſt that abſurd and <hi>fooliſh Philoſophy,</hi> which the World ſo much admired, and was propagated by the late Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and others, which had undone him and many more of the beſt parts of the Nation.<note n="*" place="margin">See my Lord <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter's</hi> Funeral Sermon preached by Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Aug. 9. 1680.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>My <hi>Lord Rocheſter</hi> being awak'd from his ſpiritual Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by a pungent <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> as appears by his <hi>Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Preached by</hi> Mr. Parſons, <hi>Augufl</hi> 9. 1680.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Preachers firſt viſit to him, <hi>May</hi> 26. My Lord thank'd God who had in <hi>Mercy and good Providence</hi> ſent him to him, who ſo much needed his Prayers and
<pb facs="tcp:97453:99"/>Counſels, acknowledging how unworthily heretofore he had treated that <hi>Order of men,</hi> reproaching them that they were proud, and Propheſied only for rewards; but now he had learnt how to value them, that he eſteem'd them the <hi>Servants of the moſt High God, who were to ſhew to him the way to everlaſting Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, (continues our Author,) I found him labouring under ſtrange trouble and conflicts of Mind, his Spirit wounded, and his Conſcience full of terrours. Upon his Journey he told me, that he had been <hi>arguing with greater vigour againſt God and Religion</hi> than ever he had done in his Life time before, and that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to run them down with all the Arguments and Spite in the World; but, like the great Convert, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he found it <hi>hard to kick againſt the Pricks,</hi> for God at that time, had ſo ſtruck his heart by his immediate hand, that preſently he <hi>argued as ſtrongly for God and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> as before he had done againſt it; that God ſtrangely opened his heart, creating in his mind <hi>moſt awful and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Thoughts and Ideas of the Divine Majeſty, with a delightful Contemplation of the Divine Nature and Attributes, and of the Lovelineſs of Religion and Vertue. I never,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>was advanc'd thus far towards happineſs in my Life before,</hi> tho' upon the commiſſions of ſome <hi>Sins extraordinary,</hi> I have had ſome checks and warnings conſiderable from within, but ſtill ſtruggl'd with them, and ſo wore them off again. The moſt obſervable that I remember, was this: One day at an <hi>Atheiſtical meeting,</hi> at a Perſon of Qualities, I undertook to manage the Cauſe, and was the <hi>principal Diſputant againſt God and Piety;</hi> and for my performances, receiv'd the Applauſe of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, upon which my Mind was terribly ſtruck, and I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately replied thus to my ſelf, <hi>Good God! That a man that walks upright, that ſees the wonderful Works of God, and has the uſes of his Sence and Reaſon, ſhould uſe them to the defying of his Creator!</hi> But tho' this was a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to my Converſion, to find my Conſcience touch'd for my ſins, yet it went off again: Nay, all my Life long, <hi>I had a ſecret value and reverence for an honest man, and lov'd morality in others.</hi> But I had form'd an odd Scheme of Religion to my ſelf, which would ſolve all that God or Conſcience might force upon me; yet I was not over-well reconcil'd to the buſineſs of Chriſtianity; nor had that <hi>Reverence for the Goſpel of Christ</hi> as I ought to
<pb facs="tcp:97453:99"/>have, which eſtate of Mind continu'd till the 53d. <hi>Chapter of Iſaiah</hi> was read to him, and ſome other portions of Scripture, by the Power and Efficacy of which Word, aſſiſted by his Holy Spirit, God ſo wrought upon his heart, that he declar'd that the <hi>mysteries of the Paſſion</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo clear and plain to him, as ever any thing did that was repreſented in a Glaſs, ſo that that joy and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration which poſſeſſed his Soul upon the reading God's Word to him, was remarkable to all about him; and he had <hi>ſo much delight in his Teſtimonies,</hi> that, in my abſence, he begg'd his <hi>Mother and Lady</hi> to read the ſame to him frequently, and was unſatisfied notwithſtanding his great pains and weakneſs, till he had learn'd the 53d. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> without Book.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time diſcourſing of his Manner of Life from his Youth up, which all men knew was too much devoted to the <hi>ſervice of Sin,</hi> and that the <hi>Luſts of the Fleſh, the Eye, and the Pride of Life</hi> had captivated him, he was very large and particular in his acknowledgments about it; more ready to accuſe himſelf than any one elſe could be, publickly crying out, <hi>O bleſſed God! Can ſuch an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Creature as I am, be accepted by thee, who has denied thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and contemn'd thy Power;</hi> asking often, <hi>Can there be mercy and Pardon for me? Will God own ſuch a Wretch as I?</hi> and in the middle of his Sickneſs ſaid, <hi>Shall the unſpeakable joys of Heaven be conferr'd on me? O mighty Saviour, never but through thine Infinite Love and Satisfaction: O never, but by the purchaſe of thy Blood;</hi> adding, that with all abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency he did reflect upon his former Life, that ſincerely and from his heart he did repent of all that folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he had committed. He had a true and lively ſence of God's great Mency to him in ſtriking his hard heart, ſaying, <hi>If that God who died for great as well as leſſer Sinners, did not ſpeedily apply his infinite Merits to his poor Soul, his wound was ſuch as no man could conceive or bear;</hi> crying out, <hi>That he was the vilest Wretch and Dog that the Sun ſhined upon, or the Earth bore; That now he ſaw his Error in not living up to that Reaſon which God endued him with, and which he unworthily vilified and contemned;</hi> wiſh'd <hi>he had been a ſtarving Leper crawling in a Ditch; that he had been a Link-Boy or a Beggar; or for his whole life time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to a Dungeon, rather than thus to have ſinned againſt God.</hi> How remarkable was his Faith in a hearty embracing and devout Confeſſion of all the <hi>Articles of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:97453:100"/>and all the Divine Myſteries of the Goſpel, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that that abſurd and fooliſh Philoſophy which the World ſo much admir'd, propagated by the late Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> and others, had undone him and many more of the beſt Parts of the Nation. He caſt himſelf entirely upon the <hi>mercies of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Free-Grace of God,</hi> declared to repenting Sinners through him, with a thankful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Life, Death and Reſurrection, begging God to ſtrengthen his Faith, and often crying out, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His mighty love and eſteem of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> his reſolutions to read them frequently, and meditate upon them if God ſhould ſpare him, having already <hi>taſted the good Word;</hi> for having ſpoken to his heart, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged all the ſeeming abſurdities and contradictions thereof, fancied by men of corrupt and reprobate Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were vaniſhed, and the Excellency and Beauty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, being come to <hi>receive the Truth in the love of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How terribly did the Tempter aſſault him by caſting upon him wicked and lewd imaginations, <hi>But I thank God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I abhor them all, and by the power of his grace, which I am ſure is ſufficient for me, I have overcome them;</hi> 
                     <q>'tis the malice of the Devil becauſe I am reſcued from him; and the goodneſs of God that frees me from all my ſpiritual enemies—</q> He was greatly rejoiced at his <hi>Ladies Converſion from Popery,</hi> which he called, <hi>a Faction ſupported only by Fraud and Cruelty.</hi> He was heartily concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>pious education</hi> of his Children, wiſhing that his Son might never be a <hi>Wit,</hi> that is, as he explain'd it, <hi>One of thoſe wretched creatures who pride themſelves in abuſing God and Religion, denying his Being or his Providence;</hi> but that he might become an honeſt and a religious Man, which could only be the ſupport and bleſſing of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. He gave a ſtrict charge to thoſe perſons in whoſe cuſtody his Papers were to burn <hi>all his prophane and lewd Writings,</hi> as being only ſit to promote Vice and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, by which he had ſo highly offended God, and ſhamed and blaſphemed that holy Religion into which he had been baptized; and all his <hi>obſcene and filthy Pictures</hi> which were ſo notoriouſly ſcandalous. I muſt not paſs by his <hi>pious</hi> and moſt <hi>paſſionate exclamation</hi> to a Gentleman of ſome Character who came to viſit him upon his Death-Bed. <hi>O remember that you contemn God no more; he is on avenging God, and will viſit you for your ſins; will in mercy,
<pb facs="tcp:97453:100"/>I hope, touch your Conſcience ſooner or later, as he has done mine. You and I have been Friends and Sinners together a great while, therefore I am the more free with you. We have been all miſtaken in our Conceits and Opinions. Our Perſuaſions have been falſe and groundleſs, therefore God grant you repentance.</hi> And ſeeing him again next day, ſaid to him, <q>Perhaps you were diſobliged by my plainneſs to you yeſterday, I ſpake the <hi>words of truth and ſoberneſs</hi> to you,</q> and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand upon his Breaſt ſaid, <hi>I hope God will touch your heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He commanded me, (continues our <hi>Author</hi>) to <hi>Preach abroad,</hi> and let all men know, if they knew it not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, how ſeverely God had Diſciplin'd him for his ſins, by his afflicting hand; that his <hi>Sufferings were moſt juſt,</hi> tho' he had laid ten thouſand times more upon him; how he had laid one ſtripe upon another becauſe of his <hi>grievous provocations,</hi> till he had brought him home to himſelf; that in his former Viſitations he had not that bleſſed Effect he was now ſenſible of. He had formerly ſome <hi>looſe thoughts and ſlight reſolutions</hi> of reforming, and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be better, becauſe even the preſent conſequences of ſin were ſtill peſtering him, and were ſo troubleſome and inconvenient to him, but now he had other <hi>ſentiments of things, and acted upon other Principles.</hi> He was willing to die, if it pleaſed God, reſigning himſelf always to the Divine Diſpoſal; but if God ſhould ſpare him yet a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time here, he hoped to bring Glory to the Name of God in the <hi>whole courſe of his Life;</hi> and particularly, by his endeavours to convince others, and to aſſure them of the danger of their condition if they continued impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and how graciouſly God had dealt with him.—<hi>The time of his Sickneſs and Repentance was just nine Weeks,</hi> in all which time, 30 hours about the middle of it except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherein he was delirous, he was ſo much <hi>Maſter of his Reaſon,</hi> and had ſo clear an underſtanding, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dictated, or ſpake more compoſed in his Life. Three or four days before his Death, he had Comfortable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of God's accepting him to his Mercy, ſaying, <q>I ſhall Die, but Oh, what unſpeakable Glories do I ſee? What Joys beyond Thought or Expreſſion am I ſenſible of? I am aſſured of God's mercy to me, through Jeſus Chriſt. O! how I long to die, and to be with my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</q>

And I do alſo heartily lament my great <hi>Neglect of putting the Laws in execution</hi> againſt common Drunkards, Swearers, and ſuch like ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Sinners; and do earneſtly <hi>beſeech</hi> all ſuch as are in Authority, and whoſe buſineſs it is to ſee the Laws executed, if any ſuch come to hear this Paper read, that they will be more careful in that particular, and conſider, that as their Power is a Talent entruſted in them, whereof they muſt give a ſtrict Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to their heavenly Lord, ſo by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duly conſcientious in the diſcharge of their Duty herein, we may hope for a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> amongſt us, and then with confidence
<pb facs="tcp:97453:102"/>expect <hi>God's Bleſſing</hi> to reſt upon us. And as I abhor my ſelf for my Neglect in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular now mentioned, and all my great ſins and Provocations againſt an Infinite Majeſty, ſo I do farther hereby deelare my full <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Reſolution,</hi> if it ſhall pleaſe Almighty God (with whom all things are poſſible) to reſtore me to Health, or prolong my days, by his ſpecial Grace and Aſſiſtance (without which I ſhall be able to do nothing) to lead a New Life in all Holy Obedience to his Will and Commands; and deſire that this <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of mine, if I fail to do ſo, may be produced as a Teſtimony againſt me, to my Shame and Reproach. But ſince my Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is very uncertain, and what I have the leaſt reaſon in the world to hope for, being heartily deſirous to do what good I can in the Circumſtances I am in, I do hereby ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly <hi>warn and beſeech</hi> all Sinners, eſpecially thoſe whom my Example has at any time encouraged, (the remembrance whereof ſtill ſills me with ſhame and ſorrow) to repent of all their ſins and provocations, leaſt God's Vengeance overtake them in their Security, and there be no Remedy. And I beſeech them farther to take Notice, that if this Warning be ſlighted, the wilfull neglect and Refuſal thereof will at laſt be charged upon them as a heinous Aggravation of all their Sins they ſhall hereater commit, will encreaſe their Condemnation, and make their Doom more dreadful and terrible: But that it may have a contrary effect, and be a means to reduce 'em from their Sins to a Holy and Religious Life, that ſo their Souls may be
<pb facs="tcp:97453:103"/>ſaved in the great Day of the Lord, is the earneſt deſire of their</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>I Have put Pen to Paper, humbly beſeeching you to hear me of your Charity a few Words. The Enemy of my Soul hath raiſed
<pb facs="tcp:97453:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>many Objections to hinder my <hi>intended purpoſe;</hi> and I have been almoſt perſwaded to give it over; but now having the advice of a Pious <hi>Holy Miniſter</hi> of God, who ſays it may be of great uſe, I deſire to take ſhame to my ſelf, and to give Glory to the Majeſty of Heaven, who in great <hi>Love and Pitty</hi> hath pluckt me as a Firebrand out of the Fire, and I am this day a <hi>Living Monument of Mercy.</hi> I cannot but be grieved at the many ſad Examples I have given at <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> My Sins have have encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heap of the publick Impieties, and made them cry the louder to Heaven for Vengeance both there and here too. It is very meet, right, and my duty to confeſs to the Glory of God and Praiſe of his Grace, my crying ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in that place, that ſome of my <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in evil may hear and fear, and do no more ſuch wickedneſs.</hi> About 9 or 10 years agone, I came a young Woman (if I deſerve that name) to <hi>P</hi>—, my Husband Cook of a Ship in that Harbour, a very ill Husband, (no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for me) Almighty God did ſuffer <hi>two ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to come together to plague one another;</hi> and whilſt he acted the part of a Drukard, with ſhame and confuſion of face be it ſpoken, I acted the part of a Harlot, giving my ſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to work all <hi>uncleanneſs with greedineſs;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that my very Name was a Proverb of Reproach to all Civil Women. Two or three years I lived openly ſcandalous, and then it pleaſed the Almighty to viſit me with a ſore fit fit of Sickneſs, even to the loſs of my Limbs for a Seaſon; at which time I did beg of God to reſtore me to my Health, and did faithfully promiſe never more to <hi>defile my Marriage Bed;</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:97453:104"/>and the Lord was intreated at that time alſo; and hath added to my life theſe remaining years. Some time after, it pleaſed the All-wiſe Providence to make me a <hi>Mother,</hi> I was very thankful for the Mercy, and was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and I was in ſome meaſure convinced of the great <hi>Evil of ſin,</hi> and did put pen to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with intent it ſhould come to the Miniſters hand; but the Enemies of my Soul prevented and hindred that reaſonable deſign, and I was again lull'd to ſleep in the Bed of Carnal Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; where I continued three or four years with little Interruption; in which time I buried my Husband and two Children. After this I was in danger of being as <hi>bad</hi> as ever, living at <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> in the very <hi>midſt of Temptation</hi> at <hi>Porthridge.</hi> I continued there but a ſhort ſpace, for the good hand of Providence brought me to <hi>London,</hi> where I had time and opportunity to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ill ſpent life. <hi>O that I might improve the mercy! O that I could tell you what God hath done for my Soul! He hath brought me out of Darkneſs into his marvellous light: O that I could prevail with my Companions in evil to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near!</hi> Some of them are old Sinners, <hi>grey hairs</hi> are upon them, and they know it not, I could be content to ſtand in a <hi>white ſhet</hi> in your Church if I might but prevail with any one Soul to ſee the heinouſneſs of my ſin: Nay, I could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be <hi>ſtoned</hi> without the walls of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, ſo I might but be a means of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any one Sinner. O that I could write theſe Lines with my <hi>pureſt Blood!</hi> I am grieved for the Diſhonour I have done to God by my abominable ſin, and heartily wiſh <hi>my Head were
<pb facs="tcp:97453:104"/>Waters and mine Eyss were a Fountain of Tears that I might weep day and night for abuſing mercy.</hi> O Sir, you live in a place relating to <hi>Sodom,</hi> cry aloud, ſpare not to tell the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt, hath made you Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, their Sins, and my Companions in evil their Sins. The Lord is coming to reckon with the Nations, and with you: God grant you may be found among the Faithful Shepherds watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them and giving them their meat in due Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I humbly beg your Bleſſing, deſiring to be <hi>remembred in your Prayers;</hi> and I humbly beſeech the Almighty, that this <hi>poor paper</hi> may have its deſigned effect, that God may be glorifi'd, and our Souls ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
